# mobtest

- Simple world demo with new entities.
- Integrated with ui-test
  - TypeScript (TSX) + React + `react-dom` (from esm.sh)
  - New UI API to add the react root, then you can define components as usual

## Building

```shell
$ npm i # for react and react-dom types
$ npm run build
$ # dist/client.js now exists and ./client.js autoexports from there
```
